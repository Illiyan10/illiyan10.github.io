    <img class="imgsize" src="SRC/IMGS/Sports.jpg" alt="Sports"> 
    <p>I really enjoy playing sports. I started off by playing soccer when I was 5. Once I reached the 7th grade, I joined my school football team. Now I have moved on from football and started playing basketball. I really enjoy sports and I hope to continue playing them throughout high school.</p>

    <h2><u>2. Listening to music</u></h2>
    <img src="SRC/IMGS/Music.jpg" alt="Music"> 
    <p>I like listening to music. It helps me concentrate whenever I am working on an assignment and it allows me to relax whenever I am stressed. I work best when listening to classical music but in my free time, I listen to rap music.</p>

      <p>I just recently started playing Fortnite. I played a while ago and I started really liking it. Although I am still very bad, I try to get better as often as I can and try to get kills.</p>
